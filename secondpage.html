    <h3>Value proposition</h3>
    <p>
      Advocates of public and hybrid clouds claim that cloud computing allows
      companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.
      Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their
      applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less
      maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources
      to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand,[4][5][6] providing burst
      computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak
      demand

    <h3>Market</h3>
    <p>
      According to IDC, the global spending on cloud computing services has
      reached $706 billion and expected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025.[8] While
      Gartner estimated that the global public cloud services end-user spending
      forecast to reach $600 billion by 2023.[9] As per McKinsey & Company
      report, cloud cost-optimization levers and value-oriented business use
      cases foresees more than $1 trillion in run-rate EBITDA across Fortune 500
      companies as up for grabs in 2030.[10] In 2022, more than $1.3 trillion in
      enterprise IT spending is at stake from the shift to cloud, growing to
      almost $1.8 trillion in 2025, according to Gartner

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      The term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as
      early as 1993, when Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&T used it in
      describing their (paired) Telescript and Personal Link technologies.[12]
      In Wired's April 1994 feature "Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II",
      Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed
      programming language: "The beauty of Telescript ... is that now, instead
      of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out
      there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources
      of information and create a sort of a virtual service. No one had
      conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript,
      X.400 and ASN.1] uses now is a date-arranging service where a software
      agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the
      ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is
      communicated to both parties.
